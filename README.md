My second attempt to make an app. Using Sqlite database.

## Getting Started

Feel free to download.

1. Download the project.
2. Download Xcode. (We need Xcode to use the iphone simulator) --> appstore
3. Download VS Code. --> https://code.visualstudio.com/download
4. Download Flutter SDK. --> https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install/macos
5. Run the app. -> either type 'flutter run' in terminal of VSCode or click 'Run/Start debugging'

### Disclaimer

There will be a lot of mistakes.
